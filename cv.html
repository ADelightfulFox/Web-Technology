                    very busy microbiology laboratory, where my role
                    consisted of carrying out various tests in a time sensitive period.
                    I have very good communication skills which was relevant within this role when speaking
                    to other health professionals regarding queries and am aware of the importance of
                    keeping confidential information disclosed and only shared on a need to know basis. I
                    have experience of inputting large volumes of data and medical records ensuring high
                    levels of accuracy.</p>
                <p>I am a very polite person who enjoys meeting new people and have excellent people
                    skills. I can work well alongside others and understand the importance of good
                    communication and team work, however I am also confident to work alone. I enjoy
                    learning and am always looking for ways to self progress that would enable me to offer.</p>
