            <h1>Development</h1>
            <p>
                Throughout the process of producing the website only minor revisions were made throughout the production due to me acknowledging beforehand what I already knew about modern websites and how they should look and react to visitors.
                It was important to make sure my pages code had validated throughout the production of the website to ensure the HTML and CSS code I had produced was correct and that I had not used code that was outdated and was up to date with modern standards,
                I did have some warnings for my HTML regarding adding headings to some of the sections but as I had included sections within a section, 
                I felt adding a heading wouldnâ€™t make sense in this scenario but with more experience I feel I would be more knowledgeable on better techniques to use and prevent these warnings. 
                Not having previous experience of coding was quite beneficial as I only learned modern techniques and meant that I only used code that was appropriate for this era. 
                I also ensured that I understood fully what code I implemented behaved and how it affected my website as I found it is very easy to find code online which could cause errors in the end result of the website with improper understanding and use.

            <h2>Display And Design</h2>
            <p>
                For my website I decided I wanted the design to be fun but simplistic in order to make it easier to navigate and keep the pages relevant. I chose a fox gif for the background as its my favourite animal and coincidently my last name which makes the website seem more personal.
                The navigation bar at the top of the screen displays which page is currently open and displays all the pages my site includes, for mobile the navigation bar switches to a simple burger menu which also displays the different pages.
                 I decided to make the layout similar to most websites on the internet as most visitors tend to have an understanding of where the navigation menu usually sits. I chose colours for my pages which contrast nicely so the text displayed was easily readable.
                  The use of boxes to contain the text produced even more of a contrast rather than sitting on the white background of the page and made the website look more professional. After experimenting with many different text fonts I decided the one that worked best was easily readable at different sizes and still looked professional while adding style.

            <h3>Difficulties and Fixes</h3>
            <p>
                I overall found learning how to use Visual Studio Code easy to understand and use, as well as understanding the different tags used in the HTML and how to use CSS files to style the pages.
                Producing the content and styling for the website was simple but it was laying out the page for the content I sometimes experienced difficulties. There was a lot of fine tuning involved in order for the website to look aesthetically pleasing on both computer and mobile version but I found using different sections in the body of the HTML made laying the content on the grid much simpler rather than it all being cluttered in one section.  
                The pages used a lot of the same HTML and CSS so it was very easy implementing items such as the navigation bar and burger menu which stayed fairly similar on each page. The use of GitHub in the design process of the website at first was difficult to understand but through lectures and tutorials,
                 my understanding was quickly established and I was able to use GitHub easily and effectively to produce multiple branches for each of my pages and upload meaningful comments when designing and editing my code. 
                 Using GitHub is beneficial when testing and making changes to the website as it meant I could edit different aspects of the page without interrupting the original website.
